PROJECT QUESTION

Let the 8 digits of your UB student number be represented as d0,d1,d2,d3,d4,d5,d6,d7. MY UB NUMBER (20017095)
Your program must be able to accept 3 distinct input values, and produce an output that is specifically
defined by three digits of your UB number d3, d4, d6 as given in the following table.

TABLE---------
1 Even Even Even Sum of the largest (L) and twice the median (M), i.e. L + 2 M
2 Even Even Odd Difference of twice the largest (L) and the smallest (S), i.e. 2L - S
3 Even Odd Even Sum of the largest (L) and twice the smallest (S), i.e. L + 2S
4 Even Odd Odd Difference of twice the median (M) and the smallest (S), i.e. 2M -S
5 Odd Even Even Sum of the median (M) and twice the smallest (S), i.e. M + 2S
6 Odd Even Odd Difference of twice the largest (L) and the median (M), i.e. 2L - M
7 Odd Odd Even Sum of twice the median (M) and the smallest (S), i.e. 2M + S
8 Odd Odd Odd Sum of twice the largest (L) and the smallest (S), i.e. 2L +S      ------------------------------------ QUESTION I SOLVED  
Remark that 0 is considered to be an even number.
